# Use TypeScript in Watch Mode

## Learning Goals

- Learn how to use TypeScript in watch mode

## Problem

We've now got a TypeScript file that compiles to JavaScript. But we have to run the TypeScript compiler every time we make a change. That's not very convenient.

See if you can find a way to run the TypeScript compiler in watch mode.

Check the TypeScript [CLI Options](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/compiler-options.html) for help.
