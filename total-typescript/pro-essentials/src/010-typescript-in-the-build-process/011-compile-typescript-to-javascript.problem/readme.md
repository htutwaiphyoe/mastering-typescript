# Compile TypeScript to JavaScript

## Learning Goals

- Learn how to turn TypeScript into JavaScript

## Problem

We're starting in the same situation as the previous exercise. Our TypeScript file doesn't work in the browser.

See if you can find a way to create a JavaScript file from the TypeScript file. You'll need to:

- Set up a `tsconfig.json`
- Run the TypeScript compiler
- Change the `index.html` file to use the JavaScript file
