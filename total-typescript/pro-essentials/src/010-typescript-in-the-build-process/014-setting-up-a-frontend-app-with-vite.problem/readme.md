# Setting up a frontend app with Vite

## Learning Goals

- Understand how to automatically reload your browser when you make code changes
- Understand how to set up a modern frontend app with Vite

## Problem

There's another DX improvement to make. We have to manually refresh the browser every time we make a change. That's not very convenient.

For that, we're going to need to start using a frontend framework. You can choose any you like, but we're going to choose `Vite`. It's a modern frontend framework that's very fast and easy to use.

See if you can find a way to set up a Vite app. You'll need to:

- Visit Vite's documentation
- Take a look at their getting started guide
- Delete all our existing code
- Create a new vite app in its place
