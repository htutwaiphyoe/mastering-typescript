// Explain when and when not to use unsafe assertions in TS

// When there are upstream issues (in a library) causing strange TS errors

// "When you know better than TypeScript"

// But this isn't very helpful for folks who aren't confident in their TS skills yet

// When you hit a horrible TS error, set a timer.
// If you haven't solved it by the end of that timer, suppress the error.
